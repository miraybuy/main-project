            It is widely believed that the history of Lorem Ipsum originates
            with Cicero in the 1st Century BC and his text De Finibus bonorum et
            malorum. This philosophical work, also known as On the Ends of Good
            and Evil, was split into five books. The Lorem Ipsum we know today
            is derived from parts of the first book Liber Primus and its
            discussion on hedonism, the words of which had been altered, added
            and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. It is not
            known exactly when the text gained its current traditional form.
            However references to the phrase "lorem ipsum" can be found in the
            1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition of the De Finibus in sections 32
            and 33.

            Advancing to the 1960s, Lorem Ipsum was made popular by typeface
            manufacturer Letraset, who used it in their advertising campaigns.
            Letraset offered pages of Lorem Ipsum as rub down transfer sheets,
            which were widely used in the pre-computer era for layouts. These
            transfer pages, known as Letraset Body Type, were featured in the
            company's advertising and their popular catalogue. Lorem Ipsum was
            reintroduced in the 1980s by the Aldus Corporation, a company that
            developed Desktop Publishing Software. Their most well known product
            PageMaker came with pre-installed graphics and word-processing
            templates containing a version of the faux latin language.
